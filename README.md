# Capstone-Project---Battle-of-Neighbourhoods

### Introduction
Toronto is a city that is quickly growing with a diverse population and lots of opportunity for business. A client wants to know where in the greater toronto area would be best to open a bar. There are a few factors that will make a bar successful and thrive. Some useful information would be the amount of competing bars in the area and the average household income of the neighbourhood.
